# Address-Falsehoods
A list of falsehoods about addresses

- **All Addresses Have Postal Codes**
  - Ireland would disagree with you (with the exception of Dublin). There are also other [countries without postal codes](https://hellowahab.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/list-of-countries-without-postal-codes/).
- **The Same Address Can't Be In Different Countries**
  - Except the fact [Büsingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCsingen_am_Hochrhein#Post_and_telecommunications) is located in the German/Swiss border area.
- **It's perfectly fine to use Zip Code instead of Postal Code**
  - Because Dick Code makes perfect sense. "zip" in Arabic means dick.
- **A person can only have one address**
  - A person can either own multiple properties or a child could have an address with mother, an address with a father, etc.
