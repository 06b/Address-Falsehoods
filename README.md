# Address-Falsehoods
A list of falsehoods about addresses

- **All Addresses Have Postal Codes**
  - Ireland would disagree with you (with the exception of Dublin). There are also other [countries without postal codes](https://hellowahab.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/list-of-countries-without-postal-codes/).
- **The Same Address Can't Be In Different Countries**
  - Except the fact [Büsingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCsingen_am_Hochrhein#Post_and_telecommunications) is located in the German/Swiss border area.
- **It's perfectly fine to use Zip Code instead of Postal Code**
  - Because Dick Code makes perfect sense. "zip" in Arabic means dick.
- **A person can only have one address**
  - A person can either own multiple properties or a child could have an address with mother, an address with a father, etc.
- **An Address will have a street name**
  - [Japan's addressing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_addressing_system) is pretty complex and most Japanese streets do not have names.
- **Postal codes should be stored in a database using an integer column**
  - Reminds me when I inherited a project that the previous developer did this and then the client sent over data with Massachusetts ZIP Codes which start with 0.
- **Postal codes won't start with a zero**
  - Norway also has postcodes which can start with a 0 (0368 is not the same as 368). **Related:** Postal codes should be stored in a database using an integer column.
- **An address postal code can't contain a space**
  - Sweden has a space after the first digit (5 4367). **Related:** Postal codes should be stored in a database using an integer column.
- **An address will start with, or at least include, a building number.**
  - Counterexample: Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, WC2E 9DD, United Kingdom.
- **An address with a building number will be all-numeric.**
  - Counterexample: 1A Egmont Road, Middlesbrough, TS4 2HT
- **An address will not have a building that is numbered zero**
  - Counterexample: 0 Egmont Road, Middlesbrough, TS4 2HT
- **Street numbers (and building numbers) don't contain fractions**
  -  43rd ½ St, Pittsburgh, PA, and of fractional building numbers. These can be written in unicode (43rd ½ St), as a fraction with a slash (43 1/2) or as a decimal (43.5)
- **An address that has a building name won't have a building number (or vice-versa)**
  -  Counterexample: Flat 1.4, Ziggurat Building, 60-66 Saffron Hill, London, EC1N 8QX, United Kingdom
